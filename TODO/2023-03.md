- diag codeXXXX : Avoid confusing names
  > diag var/function-name look like
  > local, global, static, if, else, loop, for, while, until, break, continue, goto, return, switch, case, try, catch
  > as , and, contains, false, in, is, IsSet, not, or, super, true, unset
  > [ref ahk-v2 doc](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm#names)

- diag codeXXXX : can't set `number` as variable

  ```ahk
  MsgBox, % 1999 ; 1999
  MsgBox, % 0 + 1999 + 0 ; 1999
  1999 := "9999" ; Warning, setting numbers in this format as variables has no effect
  MsgBox, % 1999 ; 1999
  ```

- diag codeXXXX : can't set `0xNumber` as variable
  > check Checks the variable name startWith `0x`

  ```ahk
  0x001 := "9999" ; Cannot set 0xNumber as variable
  MsgBox, % 0x001 ; show "0x001"
  MsgBox, % 0x001 + 0 ; show 0, Because "0x001" + 0    ->    0 + 0    ->   0

  0x001 := 9999 ; Cannot set 0xNumber as variable
  MsgBox, % 0x001 ; "0x001"
  MsgBox, % 0x001 + 0 ;
  ```

- check ahk-v1 `1e3` is not `1.e3`
  >
  > 1. _option_ diag-1 : case `0 + 1e3` , this not `1 + 1000` , If the user does not set 1e3 as a variable, maybe it is directly used as a number, I need to warn the user that this is not a number, because of the missing decimal point <https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Concepts.htm#numbers>
  > 2. _option_ diag-2 : case `1e3 := 999` , avoid variable name very much like numbers, this can cause problems for code audits.

  ```ahk
  MsgBox, % 1e3 ; space , Because `1e3 `is not 1000
  MsgBox, % 0 + 1e3 + 0 ; space , Because `1e3 `is not 1000
  ;             ^^^  **diag-1**
  1e3 := "9999"
  MsgBox, % 1e3 ; show 9999 ... **diag-2**
  ```

- diag codeXXXX: Object syntactic errors
  >
  > 1. Remarks neko-help can only work on the legal subset of ahk-v1, if there is an illegal obj, it will cause indentation errors and function scope exceptions
  > 2. The following error will directly cause ahk-v1 not to work, but to provide automatic repair, need to study for the time being.
  > 3. And, I intend to abide by my own format policy of only adjusting the blank space at the beginning of the line by default, even if the alpha option is turned on, I do not add `\n` arbitrarily and do not intend to use format to fix any syntactic errors.
  > 4. [read ahk-v1 document](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Scripts.htm#continuation)

  ```ahk
  ;err-case 1

  obj := {
      a:0 ;ahk-v1 say Error: This line does not contain a recognized action.
  }
  MsgBox, % obj.a
  ```

  ```ahk
  ;err-case 2

  obj := { ;ahk-v1 say Error:  Missing "}"
      ,a:0
  }
  MsgBox, % obj.a
  ```

  ```ahk
  ;err-case 3

  obj := { b:0
      ,a:0 ;ahk-v1 say Error:  Missing "}"
  }
  MsgBox, % obj.a
  ```

  ```ahk
  ; OK case

  obj := { b:0   ; obj open "{" , Looks like it can't be at the end of a line.
          , a:0  ; line need to start with "," 
      ,c:0}      ; obj close "}" It seems that it cannot be at the beginning of the line, it seems to be related to the continuation.
  ;---^line start with ","   -> Indicates that this line is a continuation of the previous line
  MsgBox, % obj.a ; show 0 ^_^
  ```

- fix: `HotStrings` without [T-flag/R-flag](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Hotstrings.htm#Options)

  ```ahk
  :*b0:<em>::</em>{left 5}
  ;               ^^^^^^^^special symbols, if not open T-flag
  ```

- FIXME: `/*@Ahk2Exe-Keep` _hover_ && _CompletionItem_

  ```ahk
  /*@Ahk2Exe-Keep
  MsgBox This message appears only in the compiled script
